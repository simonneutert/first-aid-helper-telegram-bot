# First Aid Helper Support Bot for telegram

this is a very simple first aid bot. It is supposed to be easily extended with many more languages.

The bot primarily aims to be a sort of refresh tutorial. But could be used as a guide in a situation of emergency, too.

It is interactive with buttons, following the medical predefined paths of action.
