    unconscious_not_breathing_hint: |
      You're supposed to pump 100 to 120 times per minute. Cooperate with somebody else if possible.

      Keep pumping until the ambulance arrives, if the injured does not show any reaction coming back to life. 

      The best rhythm for pumping is: STAYING ALIVE by the BeeGees
